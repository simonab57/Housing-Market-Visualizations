## Overview of the Analysis: Housing Market Visualizations
Finding investing opportunities in San Francisco's housing market using visualizations, aggregation, and geospatial analysis. The first step of this notebook is to calculate and plot the housing units per year in the San Francisco market. After doing so, we will then calculate and plot the average sales price per unit, and graph that as well. Similar to the previous step, we will use the average sales price results and compare it to each neighborhood. Lastly, we will build an interactive neighborhood map for better visualization and analysis.
